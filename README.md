# document-search-engine
This project is a document search engine that allows users to search through .txt, .pdf, .doc, and .docx files within a specified directory and its subdirectories. The search engine uses semantic embeddings generated by a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model to perform similarity searches, providing relevant document content as search results.
